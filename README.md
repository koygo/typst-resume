# Typst Resume Template

Please view the example CV's and see how you can adjust the template for yourself.

Refer to Pavlic's original TeX CV for the original file, [here is the original repo](https://github.com/tpavlic/latex_cv_template).

Unlike the lengthy **Required LaTeX Packages** required for the original TeX CV, all you need to compile this template is **Typst**. [You can install it here](https://github.com/typst/typst?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
