# Typst Resume Template

Please view the example CV's and see how you can adjust the template for yourself.

For the original files, refer to [Pavlic's TeX CV](https://github.com/tpavlic/latex_cv_template).

Unlike the lengthy **Required LaTeX Packages** required for the original TeX CV, all you need to compile this template is **Typst**. 

[You can install it here](https://github.com/typst/typst?tab=readme-ov-file#installation), and then simply run:

`typst compile [filename].typ`

and it will compile your pdf.
